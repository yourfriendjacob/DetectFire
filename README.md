# DetectFire
An app like Tinder, but for reasonable things like DnD and table top gaming.

### PURPOSE

  "The secret we should never let the gamemasters know is that they don't need any rules."
  --Gary Gygax

Let users find DnD and other table top games near their location so they can go play.
Similar to how the app Tinder works. So you give the app your location and info about
yourself and then it tells you about games within a specified radius of your location.
Will support finding both irl games and online games.

### PROJECT STRUCTURE

MASTER BRANCH:
  Branch with code that is determined to be "release-able".

STABLE BRANCH:
  Branch with code that is stable, but missing features to be "release-able".
  This branch is the ONLY one that should be merged with Master. NO OTHER BRANCH
  IS TO BE MERGED WITH MASTER.

FEATURE BRANCHES:
  All feature branches will emcompass a single jira task. They are to be named
  after their jira task.
  They will be of the format: DEFIRE-######.

### PULL REQUEST AND REVIEW
When a task is deemed complete, it must be pull requested before being merged with stable.
Once a code review has been completed and colaberators have accepted the changes, the feature
branch will be merged with stable.
When a story has been completed, there will be a code review to merge stable to Master.
